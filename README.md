Notes for courses of the CS Bachelor Degree at the University of Pisa

## What is this repo?

This repo contains some of the notes I've taken as a CS student at the University of Pisa.
The repo also has my solutions to the exercises given in the several lab courses.

Since I enrolled in 2019, I have studied under the *old system*, so some of my notes might not be up to date anymore,
or they might not cover the contents of new courses. Anyway, I hope some of them can be of use!

## Can I trust your notes?

**Absolutely not!** Most of my notes are incomplete, and every one of them contains some mistakes (which, as always in these
cases, are mine and mine alone). So take everything with a grain of salt and **triple-check** my notes with
the lectures and your own notes. 

Also, I somewhat like to write overly complicated statements just to be happy with myself,
and sometimes if I'm interested enough in something I might decide to expand on what was covered in the lectures. 

As a result, my notes might contain *more* than the actual content of the course, so be sure to check the syllabus!

## Can I at least trust the exercises?

Probably not: most of it should work, but I may have thrown in the repo also incomplete code and I'm too lazy to check
everything. So as always use it at your peril!

(But since most of the lab courses have changed most of my code will be useless)

## I have found a mistake! What do I do?

Open an issue, or write to me! (Is it even possible to chat with somebody on GitHub?)
I'll fix the mistake as soon as I can!
